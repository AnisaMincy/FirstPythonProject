# FirstPythonProject
This is my first python project. It is text-based adventure game
This is kinda lame, but I'm proud of it. It is the first time that I put code together to actually create something.
It's a work in progress. 
You can use this code, build upon it, or mix it up. Whatever you think is suitable.
